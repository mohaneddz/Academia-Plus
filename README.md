# 🏫 Academia Plus — School-Management-System

---

## 📌 Overview
**Academia Plus** is a **C++ Qt prototype** simulating a school management system.  
It models students, teachers, courses, and exams in a **desktop application environment**.  

This prototype was built in **20 days** as a non-mandatory assignment, focused on exploring software design, class hierarchies, and Qt interface development. It is fully **offline**, using **C++ file handling** for data storage.

---

## 🎨 Project Design
- Interface designed with **Qt Widgets**, aiming for a **minimalist, modern UI**.  
- Classes structured with **arrays, vectors, pointers, and external functions** to explore C++ capabilities.  
- Dynamic widget and layer adjustment for responsive interface.  
- **Local storage** ensures the app works entirely offline.  

> ⚠️ The codebase may be inconsistent due to experimentation but reflects valuable learning.

## 🗺️ Project Journey

### Timeline ⏳
- Completed in **20 days**, with extensive **rework due to evolving requirements**.  
- Added complexity over time as features and problem-solving approaches evolved.

### Challenges & Motivation 💪
- Transition from **arrays to vectors** mid-project.  
- **Dynamic memory allocation** and function adaptation to Qt.  
- Redesign to support **multiple teacher roles** and **student year levels**.  
- Scheduling system shifted to be **course-focused**.

### Rework Highlights ♻️
- Some features removed or simplified:
  - Icon customization for courses, teachers, students  
  - Easter eggs and personalized UI features  
  - Simplified scheduling system  
  - Streamlined course/exam detail handling  

> Features like multi-year management and manual data saving/loading were omitted due to complexity.
